My RCOS project Whiteboard that was started in the spring semester has finally been released into beta. It is a Django project and has had a lot of work done on it before preparations were made for deployment. What I didn't realize is as the size of the project grows without attempting to deploy things can become complicated. Django also has a lot of settings to configure. Eventually I got it working with Apache on AWS with S3 storage and an RDS.

There was a lot that went wrong but now I know a lot more and feel it has only helped me grow as a developer. This semester has seen a large growth in my broadening knowledge. Javascript went from a scary and afraid to touch to something to I have worked on and feel comfortable looking at. This is thanks to 2 hackathon projects written entirely with Javascript using node.js.
