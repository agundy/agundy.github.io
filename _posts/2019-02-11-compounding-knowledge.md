title: Compounding Knowledge in Programming
---

I read this article [Compounding Knowledge](https://fs.blog/2019/02/compounding-knowledge/)
from Farnam Street and enjoyed it. The article talks about lifetime learning
and figuring out what to learn.  There is a ton of information out there and it
is not all correct or tested.  How do you pick what to read and learn? Tons of
smart people have different answers, some only read books published at
least 10 years ago, others read no news. Can we apply a similar principle to
help us keep up in technology?

In the fast moving programming world Hacker News has new frameworks and
technology daily, but can we can find knowledge and patterns with longer half
lifes. Technology is infamous for being fast moving and constantly changing but
as things change, a lot does not. Skills and technologies you can learn
that will be compounding knowledge:

- Debugging programs and systems
- Editing and reading text.
- Managing text
- Managing, storing and accessing data
- Learning

## Debugging 

Do you write perfect code the first time? Do you only use other code that is
perfect? Probably not. For most of us, things will go wrong. __How we handle
when things do not work is a transferrable skill that will not stop being
useful.__

Learning to break down what is happening, validating assumptions, and
inspecting components that are not how you expected are the basics of debugging.
Of course there are multitudes of debugging tools that can help and pieces to
learn about but these come with time and experience. To start on the debugging
path you just need to print output from your program.

Pages could and have been written on debugging but one other thing to learn is
to not be afraid to jump into code you use. Sometimes your code will be correct
but a library, language or even operating system will be effecting your code.

These debugging skills can probably even help you outside of computers!

## Editing Text

_The year is 2019, text is so 1970's, when you need to program you hop into VR
and ... open up a text editor._

Yeah, when you need to program you open up a text editor, that same tool that's
been around for decades. Emacs and Vi were both initally released 43 years ago.
People still use these tools today! Of course since then we have gotten a lot
more editors and IDE's but in 43 years we have still rely on reading and
editing text. 

Editor wars have flamed on for decades and the fires will burn for decades
more. People love to tie their programming identities and credentials to being
able to use a particular editor, it really __does not matter which though, pick a
text editor and get good at using it.__ Using a text editor well will not stop
being useful anytime soon.

## Managing Text

As a programmer we are not just editing text; we need to view, search, track
changes, build a mental map of how things work, etc. To help you do this there
are a tools that will pay dividends long term, pick some and practice using
them.

What was this function doing when it worked? What did it use to do? These are
important questions that will help you if you know the answer to. If you use
version control for your source code you should be able to find that out.
Knowing how to use and track changes like this is useful almost daily.

Once you are working in an established code base or on a team with other
members there will be code that you have not seen before or that you have not
read in a while. You are going to need to figure out what is going on in the
code. If you learn to search and jump around with your editor or the command
line you can jump into new projects and languages easier.

If you want to learn how to use the command line for managing text here are
useful tools start: moving files (`mv`), removing files (`rm`), searching for
text (`grep`), end of a file (`tail`), and word or line count (`wc`). There are
a bunch more but if you start here you can dig in and learn more.

## Testing Code

Once code is written it starts to rot. Not literally but your brain will 
decide to forget details on exactly why you wrote what you did and the
programming library, API or language you use will update and your code will no
longer work correctly. Sometimes the code works great but it needs to change
because your requirements changed.

How do we know what still works and what changed or broke? If you move a bunch
of code around does it still work? Of course you will manually run it and check
that it compiles or looks right but how do you know? You don't. __Verifying code
is important and comes from having automated testing.__

Knowing how, what, when and where to test code is a really important skill that
translates well across all programming and I would qualify as compounding
knowledge. Writing testing this will also help guide design decisions and help
your code last longer so you can solve new problems, not old ones.

## Managing, Storing and Accessing Data

Databases and data storage are a huge component of nearly every software
project. Understanding what your project needs for data storage and then
implementing it correctly is an important task. If you use the wrong tool or
the right tool in the wrong way your project can be technically awesome still a
failure.

Databases can get complex; understanding the access patterns you need, the
tradeoffs between database types, using caches correctly, and more will come
with experience. To get started though a good place to start is to pick up a
skill that is still being used 45 years after it appeared: SQL.

SQL is a programming language for defining, accessing and processing data from
databases. It is used today by almost every technology company in some aspect
and the fundamentals generalize well to other databases and technologies.

## Learning

Improving your ability to learn is going to continue to help no matter what
happens next in your career or in programming. Technology is constantly
changing but if you continue to focus on improving your ability to learn while
adding some knowledge that sticks for the next round you will have success.

You do not have to learn every new technology or framework, instead focus on
the problems you want to solve and try to learn what the tools are doing to
solve those problems. Learn the problem's details and what you need is useful
and will save you a lot of time and can enable super powers of getting stuff
done.

Identifying what you do not know, understanding how to learn that and then
discerning what you need and do not is a valuable learning skill will come back
over and over again.
