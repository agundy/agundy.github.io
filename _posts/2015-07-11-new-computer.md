Started my first desktop build today. I previously had an old desktop but it was slow and not worth using because my laptop would beat it hands down. Now that I'm making money as an intern as a software engineer I figured now was as good as time as any to build a system. I took a trip to Micro Center and got everything I needed. My old desktop had a power supply and hard drive I didn't need to replace. Everything else went. Even the case. My new desktop isn't a gaming rig. Just everything I need for programming and other work. 

My new system:

- Case: Fractal Design Core 1000
- Processor: i5-4690K
- RAM: 2x4GB (16 GB future plans)
- Motherboard: Gigabyte H97M-D3H
- Keyboard: DK2108SZ

 and staying from my old system:
- Hard Drive: 500 GB
- PSU: 580W

all and all this is comparable to my laptop specs but for much cheaper and much more room for expansion. Looking into SSD's as that is a needed add on. Excited for the desktop. I have been hoping to get the opportunity to build a desktop for a while. Look out for more updates on my new system. Upgraded to Ubuntu 15.04 so I will probably have comments on that as well.
