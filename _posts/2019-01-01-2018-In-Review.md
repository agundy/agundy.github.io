Another year down and how did we do? I had a great year. Highlights were
learning a lot, traveling to new places, and improving my health and fitness. 

# Goal Progress

2018 was a year with mixed success with goals. I had a bunch of goals and hit
some but not all. 

## Reading

My 2018 book reading goal was 40 books. That was quite an ambitious goal that I
did not meet. I completed 20 books, only half of my goal. You can follow my
notes and see all books at [/about/reading](/about/reading) but here is an
inlined list of some of the most influential books I read(in alphabetical order):

- Antifragile
- Chaos Monkeys
- Educated
- Hyperion
- I Contain Multitudes
- Snowball: Warren Buffet
- The Black Swan
- The Left Hand of Darkness
- The Traitor Baru Cormorant

Though I did not hit my quantity goal, this years reading was still a success.
I read a few new genres like thrillers, discovered a few classic sci-fi's that
I loved and made my way through some really interesting biography and business
books. My book reading was also augmented by a lot of articles, blog posts and
technical papers I read too. Not bad Aaron.

## Fitness

I set two major fitness goals for 2018:

1.) Continue running and run my second half marathon.

My running goal was successful, I ran my second half marathon in October with a
time of 1:52, only three minutes off my 2017 half time of 1:49. I also
completed my first 10k and ran a few fun 5k races througout the year.

Some overall 2018 Strava stats for fun:

- **Miles:** 266.8
- **Hours:** 40 hours and 46 mins
- **Elevation Gain:** 4,948 ft
- **Runs:** 74

2.) Climb at a V5 level bouldering.

I did not hit this goal unfortunately but not intentionally. Last year I
started the year predominately bouldering but as the year progressed I ended up
top roping way more than bouldering since my main climbing partner is not a big
boulderer. The spirit of this goal was to improve my climbing though and I did
that. I went from climbing 5.9's and 5.10- to being able to handle 5.10's, most
5.11's and I can project and get a few 5.12a's. This is a big milestone for me
and it's been fun watching my progress through the year.

## Cooking, Eating and Health

I worked on eating healthier and trying new recipes this year. Michelle and I
love to cook and always enjoy trying to cook new cuisines and dishes. I set a
goal of 24 dishes, honestly I stopped keeping track but I know we hit this. One
thing that was new and fun was signing up for a CSA vegetable share in the
summer. We ended up trying a bunch of veggies and found a new favorite
vegetable: Hakurei Turnips!

I hoped to lose 10 pounds this year and did not. I ate (relatively) healthy,
worked out a bunch and got a lot stronger climbing though and I think this one
can be a pass.

## Miscellaneous Goals I Did Not Hit

1. Take two college classes online.
2. Read a book in German.
3. Go backpacking

These goals were rather specific and required dedicated intentions of
completing. I did not work on these and I did not get them done. In the future
I might try to make more actionable goals or write out intentions instead of
specific goals without details.

# 8,760 Hours Review

For this part of the review I'm roughly summarizing the output of my
reflections from a helpful PDF I found called 
[8,760 Hours](https://alexvermeer.com/8760hours/). The document walks through
twelve categories and has questions to reflect on covering most areas of life.
I picked a few categories' responses and summarized below.

## Contribution & Impact

This year I contributed back with time and energy volunteering for a few events
like <a href="http://railsbridge.org/">Railsbridge</a> and <a
href="https://hackdiversity.com/">Hack.Diversity</a>. I also have been working
on mentoring some newer developers where I can. At BookBub I organized Geek
Lunches to help engineers grow and learn more.  Overall I enjoy helping others
learn and grow, especially in technical fields but not only technical skills.

## Location & Tangibles

I'm living in a cool little apartment in Cambridge. This year I spent energy
working to simplify my life. I have collected a lot of things over the years
and not everything is used or loved. I made a point of donating clothes, gear
and other items that don't get used much. This year is the first time where I
recognized I have almost everything I need and I try keeping my wants limited. 

## Money & Finances

Another good year on the finances part, I graduated two years ago with a ton of
student loans and I have been aggressively paying them back. I have determined
my financial priorities, some short and mid term goals and now I just need to
continue working on them.

One financial lesson I learned is budgets are hard, I went off and on
attempting to stick to a budget, and it did not really work. What I do instead
is have everything required be automatic and only allow myself to spend a
little of what's left over my account, with everything on auto pay including
loan and retirement savings there it takes effort to stop myself from saving, a
good spot to be.

## Education & Skill Development

Always the continuous learner I have grown and learned a ton this year. My
interests and skill development has been a little eclectic though. This past
year I spent a bunch of time learning about personal finances and productivity.
Learning these things now will hopefully pay dividends for years to come.

## Social Life & Relationships

I made some great new friends this year and strengthened older relationships.
One thing I really appreciated this year was being able to hit up old friends
and feel like we just hit it off again. Good friends do not need to be in
constant contact. We all have busy lives but taking 10 minutes to send a
thinking of you email or text and starting a great conversation is awesome.

## Productivity & Organization

Productivity and organization is a regular process of honing, reevaluating and
adapting to changing circumstances. This happened again this year and I'm sure
it will change many more times.

One big change from me came from dropping social media from my phone in the
beginning of the year. I reinstalled Instagram and Twitter but I have a much
looser attachment to them. I highly reccomend this technique and will probably
repeat soon to help prevent the addicting hooks from digging back in.

### Productivity Tools

#### Evernote

For most of the year I was on a Mac and my productivity tools were based around
the native Evernote app which is fantastic on Mac. Unfortunately the web
interface does not compare and since moving back to Ubuntu, I moved to a `docs`
folder in Dropbox. Inside this folder is a tree with subfolders and Markdown
notes. Not as flashy or as powerful but it's mine and it works well, especially
since I can edit in Vim. 

#### Task Warrior

This is a fun new addition to my software tools. I have not committed to this
100% but I have been using <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/">Task Warrior</a>
to track explicit to-do's with tags and priorities. It then presents tasks as
an ordered list of your to-do's sorted by highest priority first. This has been
helpful for finishing tasks I start and forget to finish as well as determining
what needs to be worked on next.

#### Paper Notebook

I have two notebooks: a work notebook and a home notebook. I use these for
meeting notes, brainstorms, jotting down tasks, drawing diagrams, etc, whatever
I need. Splitting work and home makes sense for me. I am still experimenting
with brands. I just finished a Moleskine soft cover and I am using a Rhodia
with my new job and enjoying it so far. I loosely follow some bullet jornal
techniques but try not to over complicate.

## Adventure & Creativity

Adventure? Got that in the bag. This year was a good year for adventure. Some
highlights:

1. Camping in Acadia
2. Multiple outdoor bouldering and top roping trips
3. Learning to lead climb
4. Seattle and Mt. Rainier Trip
5. Hikes and other fun day trips

## Summary

Wow we made it this far! That was a lot to cover and this was the abbreviated
version. Maybe you skipped a section or two or wanted to read the end first.
How did the year go? Any big takeaways? This was a great year for me.
Nothing stands out as an outstanding accomplishment or big announcement but
this year was full of awesome small steady wins. I hope these wins compound and
help me power through 2019. 

I didn't hit all my goals but I am not dissapointed in myself. The things I did
accomplish were awesome and I am still learning. I hope I can make 2019 a little
more focused on the direction I am going and align my goals closer with
priorities I discovered this year.

Happy new years and good luck on your journey in 2019, put in good work.
