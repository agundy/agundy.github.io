I started compiling a list of all the books I've read over the last few
years. Looking to post my reviews and titles [here](/about/reading/). This list
will be growing over time. I also don't plan on stopping to post on Goodreads
or BookBub but instead use this as the source of truth and syndicate my
posts/notes/reviews to other sites.

What are your methods of tracking and referencing books you've read?
