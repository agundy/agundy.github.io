I didn't create a post outlining 2018 goals because it felt a little clich√©. Now that I'm a month into my goals and the hub-bub and planning has died down I wanted to document my public goals. 

**Fitness Goals**

1. Run a half marathon
2. Climb at V5 bouldering/5.12 top rope
3. Go on a backpacking trip 

**Professional Goals**

1. Blog regularly(minimum 6 posts)
2. Attend a tech conference
3. Launch two simple projects
4. Improve writing through blogging and reading

**Learning Goals**

1. Take two online classes in new subjects
2. Read 40 books

**Hobby Goals**

1. Make 24 new dishes
2. Learn some Korean

I hope to follow through with these goals and will be blogging about my progress.
