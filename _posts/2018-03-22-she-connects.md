[Venture Cafe](http://vencaf.org/) had an event _She Connects_ a night
celebrating women entrepreneurs. I attended a town hall on women in tech and
here are my notes, broken into the four parts discussed

### Pipeline

_Encouraging women in tech, bringing and keeping them in the workforce._

- Learning and motivation does not come from expensive kits. Can just be encouragement and giving role models, and learning fundamentals.
- Suggested to socialize young boys and girls to see females as engineers. Having boys see women engineers can go a long way for them accepting their female peers as future engineers.
- Job descriptions need to be inclusive and not signalling male culture. Example given was stereotypical male nerd culture like Star Wars should not be in a job description.
 

### Mentoring

_Mentoring and growing women in tech._

- Mentoring is a two way relationship, there needs to be a reciprocal benefit. How can you add value for your mentor?
- Male mentors are just as important as female mentors. Males have the ability to make a difference. Males may also have privilege they can leverage to help their mentee.

### Leadership

_How women in tech can be a leader._

- Part of being a leader is confidence.Confidence is knowing the value you represent. Know what experience, education, and skills you have.
- Leaders are forward thinking. Work from where you want to be in a year backwards and then execute. Apply this same strategy to the business.
- Passion is important in a leader and your team members can tell if you are passionate.
- Female leadership often looks different than the male assertive culture. Work to redefine leadership to be more nurturing and reflective.

### Strategic Partnerships

_Connection women to opportunities that may be typically "boys club"_

- Women are given less opportunities than men because of culture and assumptions.
- Forums focused on women entrepreneurs are a great way to be open, give back and keep the conversation open.
- Some aspects of start-up culture like pitch competitions are more suited for male bravado and can be exclusive.
