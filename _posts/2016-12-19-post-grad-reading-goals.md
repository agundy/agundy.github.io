Science tells us we should read and successful people make it a priority, so why have I not been reading regularly? During college it is easy to make excuses and say you are too busy or don't have time to read. I used these excuses over and over again but I don't really believe them. This past semester I began reading almost daily and it did not hurt my grades or sleep, but by the end of the semester I had stopped reading altogether. Now that I am done with the semester I am trying to catch up on my goal of reading 18 books this year. To do this I need to read five books before January 1st.

During the semester I started the Elon Musk biography and listening to Sapiens on Audible. Since the semester ended I have since finished both of these and I am on to my next books. My read list is always growing and I want to start reading it down again. Below is my quick reviews of the two books I just finished and a peek at what's next on the list.

**Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance**

This biography was really engaging and inspiring. As a creative,engineering individual I was motivated by Musk's enthusiasm, ingenuity, and work ethic. A recommended read for anyone interested in science and engineering or entrepreneurship.

**Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari**

Sapiens was a thought provoking overview of the rise of homo sapiens as the dominate species. This book challenged a lot of assumptions I had on society and humans. Was extremely interested in the idea that belief in a common fiction is a powerful method of allowing us to work together.

**Up Next**

To finish off the year I plan on reading the following four books:

- The Ten Day MBA by Steven A. Silbiger (started)
- David & Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell
- Merchants of Doubt by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway
- Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg

Going forward I hope to build a habit of reading at least a half an hour every day. There are a lot more great books out there to read and much to learn. Have any recommendations for me? Reach out on Twitter [@agundy_](https://twitter.com/agundy_)
