title: Must Have Programs For Linux
---

I do all my work in Linux and I have a few programs I could not live without. The programs I like are all over the place and this list may grow.

- ####[i3](http://i3wm.org/ "i3wm")
   A powerful, tiling windows manager. i3 is an awesome windows manager that helps me be productive and stay organized as I work. Here is a taste of what is going on while I write this post.

- ####[Autojump](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump "Autojump")  
   An awesome program for navigating the command line. Autojump stores where you cd into and you can type `j` and part of the directory name you want to be in and j will guess where you want to be and get you there.

- ####Tree  
   Another command line tool. Tree gives you a prettier output than ls and shows subdirectories and files. And when you pass it the `-L` flag followed by a number it will only show items to that many layers below current level.

- ####vim  
   Always use for quick edits of text files. I love not having to leave the Terminal.

- ####[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ "Dropbox")  
   Used to sync all of my school files and have them readily accessible from my tablet, phone or even a school computer.
   
- ####inotify  
   A handy little program that monitors file system events and pipes output to your programs. Used to write this handy little script that runs the command you set everytime a file is changed in a directory. I use it all the time to rebuild a project after I update something. Works extremely well with Makefiles. This script is a child of [Seve](http://www.seveibar.com/) and I.
