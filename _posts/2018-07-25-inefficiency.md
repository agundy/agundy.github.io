I received a recommendation to listen to this
[podcast episode](https://www.ministryofideas.org/episodes/inefficiency)
from my brother. An interesting analysis of efficiency. As a tech worker it hit
home. It covers origins of the definition of efficiency to how it's used today.
Efficiency by definition is the effectiveness of creating the output versus the
input. Not everything can or should be measured and prioritized for efficiency
but it's become the end goal for many things. The podcast explains that
efficiency describes how well you control a system but not the what you are
working towards. The most efficient system isn't always the best.

This podcast was a call to slowing down and being a little inefficient. Not
everything can be analyzed measured but are still valuable. When applying this
to programming I think about taking time to unwind, think, and prioritize.
Measuring productivity in lines of code is universally shamed and spending
hours debugging an issue can also be ineffective. Sometimes the best option is
to be (in)efficient and step away. When you come back refreshed you may be more
efficient, and if not you took a break to enjoy life.
