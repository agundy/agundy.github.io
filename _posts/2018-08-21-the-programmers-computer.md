Mac, Windows, Linux. Everyone has an idea of what type of computer makes a
developer. Social media is covered with pictures of 4k displays and brand new
MacBooks. Technology sites are always talking about the newest computers and
updated hardware. But these expensive laptops, monitors and desks are not what
make a great developer's computer. The programmer's best computer is the one
they have. Modern computers can handle most everything you throw at it and
external displays are helpful but not necessary for programming.

Before dropping hundreds to thousands on computer equipment, try to use what
you have. It might not be as sexy or cool looking but it will work. If you are
getting a new computer to start programming what is wrong with your current
one? Windows and you want to get a Mac? Try dual booting Linux to get a more
Mac like development environment without the price tag. Poor battery life? Try
replacing the battery for much cheaper than a new laptop. Actually need a new
computer? Buy it, just make sure you can afford it. Don't buy a new laptop to
become a developer or to improve, buy it because you need to replace your old
one or you want it.

This really is a message to myself, I've been eyeing new computers a lot
recently. Even though I have an old working Thinkpad X1 Carbon, I just don't
like the keyboard layout. Do I need a new computer? No. Will I get a new one?
Not yet.

How about you? What is your computer situation? Do you unnecessarily consider
upgrading your computer? Disagree on buying a new computer?
