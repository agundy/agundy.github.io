title: Business Card Reader
description: |
    <p>
      For a final project for my Introduction to Computer Vision class I worked on a contact information extracter
      with a partner. We built a web app that you could upload an image to and our code would find the business card
      in the image, crop to the card and then process the card looking for regions of interests. Those regions of
      interest were then fed through the OCR engine Tesseract and then the returned text was proccessed and returned
      in a user friendly manner for tagging contact info.

    For this project I built the web site backend in Flask with a RQ job queue. Image processing was done with OpenCV
     and then the results were fed through Tesseract. This project was a lot of fun and I learned a lot of diverse
     technologies bringing it together.
