    Alfred the Butler Bot is a project I joined freshman year at RPI. I was part of a great team producing a soda dispensing robot that would wander around and dispense soda.
    Difficulties prevented the drink dispensing from working for activity day but we compromised by modifying it to shoot Nerf darts on demand.
