      - title: The Traitor Baru Cormorant
        version: eBook
        notes: >
          I thoroughly enjoyed this read. I don't know how to describe the
          genre but a little sci-fi, historical and political. Baru's home
          island is colonized when she is a young girl. She works to avenge and
          free her island from inside the government that colonized. A
          political and accounting savant Baru is tasked with managing taxes
          for a divided and rebellious region to prove her worth to the shadowy
          government.
      - title: Antifragile
        version: Audiobook
        notes: >
          There are not just two states fragile and robust, there is a third
          one, antifragile. Robust things do not break like a fragile thing
          will but robust things don't get stronger with time or random events.
          Antifragile systems do; they limit the exposure to downside and expose
          themselves to the upside if things go well. I found this book really
          engaging, novel and thought provoking. I would love to reread this
          and discuss with someone.

          Really interesting, casual introduction to the advances we are making in understanding how the microbiome influences our health. I enjoyed learning how new symbiosis's are changing the tides against diseases like dengue. Great read for the armchair scientist. 
      - title: The Perfect Stranger
      - title: Children of Dune
      - title: Hyperion
        notes: >
          Really enjoyed this! Loved the world and the storyâ€™s were cool. It felt rushed at the end though and it left me wanting more! Guess I have to go get the second book.
      - title: The Fall of Hyperion
        notes: >
          Enjoyed this read! Was surprised in the resolution but had fun along the way. The first book was a lot different but this pulled everything together nicely.
      - title: The Black Swan
        notes: >
          I really enjoyed this book. Nassim Taleb makes a great case for not modeling and viewing the world through a Gaussian statistics lens. Instead we are in the world black swan events, or Extremistan as he calls it. Where the highly improbably and unpredictable events are what shape the world. Recommended read for anyone interested in business, economics and similar topics.
      - title: Design of Everyday Things
      - title: "Snowball: Warren Buffet"
      - title: Salvage Trouble
        notes: >
          A fun quick read. Is eerily similar to Firefly but I still enjoyed it. Has a little twist with wizards and left me interested in the next book in the series.
      - title: In the Beginning Was the Command Line
        notes: >
          An analogy filled 100+ page review of operating systems. Talks about the development of Mac vs Windows and the authors personal favorite OS, BeOS. A little sensational and opinionated about GUI's. After finishing this book I was sad that I'm on a Mac and not using a Linux laptop at work. Read it if you are looking for a quick book/long oped on computer operating systems. It's worth it.
