<p>
Growing up I was a natural explorer and inventor, playing with
technology, tearing old appliances apart, reading everything I could
get my hands on and creating new products was normal entertainment for
me. Many 12 year olds dream of being sports stars, firefighters, rock
stars, etc, I only wanted to be an engineer. Through high school I took
many classes to realize this dream and then I went to Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute where I realized my dreams.

I graduated with a
degree in Computer Science in December 2016. And I now work as a
software engineer in Boston.
