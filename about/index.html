        Growing up I was a natural explorer and inventor, playing with
        technology, tearing old appliances apart, reading everything I could
        get my hands on and creating new products was normal entertainment for
        me. Many 12 year olds dream of being sports stars, firefighters, rock
        stars, etc, I only wanted to be an engineer. Through high school I took
        many classes to realize this dream and then I went to Rensselaer
        Polytechnic Institute where I realized my dreams. I graduated with a
        degree in Computer Science in December 2016. And I now work as a
        software engineer in Boston. Outside of work I enjoy lots of hobbies
        including:
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking(and of course eating)</li>
            <li>Programming</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Hiking</li>
            <li>Biking</li>
        </ul>

            I am passionate about open source software and I worked with 
            <a href="http://rcos.rpi.edu/" title="RCOS">RCOS(Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software)</a>
            as a Coordinator and software developer while at RPI. Now that I
            graduated I mentor and provide expertise for current students. I
            worked on building open source culture, encouraging developer
            growth and organizing events and meetings. I previously worked with
            Rensselaer's Dean of Students Office's Summer STEM camps with
            middle and high school students introducing them to college life
            and inspiring and preparing them for careers in science,
            technology, engineering and math.
